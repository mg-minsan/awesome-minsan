# Tools

## Coding
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) I Mainly use it for frontend development.
[Github](https://github.com/) is Where all my public codebases are.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) Terminal multiplexer.

## Productivity
- [TickTick](https://ticktick.com) Todo List app. I used it to keep track of all my work both for personal and work.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Text Editor powered by Markdown. I use it mainly for [journaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H65tRCc-qyQ). Planning to create my [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) notes with it.
- [Freedom](https://freedom.to) Block websites and apps for a period you set. I use it while I'm working or whenever I need a break from the internet. 
- [Rescue Time](https://rescuetime.com) Track your app and website usages and generate analyses. It also has blocker ability but is limited only to focus (work) sessions. I use it to track my screen time although it has the blocking feature like Freedom, It's still worthwhile to see the statistics of my screentime usage.

## Learning
- [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com) It's where I read most of my Tech Related books and have 80% of the books I want to read. It's a bit priecy though. Tip. they have a huge discount on Cyber Monday every year.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) I use Udemy when I need to learn something quickly. Tip. If you are in Singapore, you can access Udemy Business for free if you are an NLB Member. You can check the instructions [here](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/Browse?browseBy=type&filter=18).
